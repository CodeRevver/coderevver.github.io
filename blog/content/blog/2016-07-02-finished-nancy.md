I managed to finish the first draft of the NancyFx code review this week.  It’s a little smaller than the ServiceStack one but I’ve been working on it for less time.  I think it’s an OK article just now, but I realised this week that writing performance reviews of the framework is not that feasible for me.  Not only would I have to make quite a large API in the framework, along with a large dataset, I’d have to test it with multiple users making requests at the same time etc, it’s just not feasible or cost effective (the performance measuring software is expensive).  It has really made me think about what I should be talking about in the articles.

The next article I want to write about is Microsofts WebAPI.  I have been slagging it off on my other articles, but I realise now that I have been assimilating the other 3rd party framework creators’s ideas so I’d like to look at the framework in a new light (and perhaps update previous reviews in the light of new information).

## This isn’t going to make me any money
It has really sunk in that the Blog and CodeReviewer.co.uk isn’t likely to make any money, but that’s OK.  Over the last 4 weeks I’ve learned a lot about different frameworks and It has made writing the articles very worthwhile.  The problem comes in that If this isn’t making me any money, and isn’t likely to, what can I do that WILL make me money?

I’ve been toying with the idea of reselling computer parts/clothes/whatever.  The good thing about it is I would be selling tangible goods – not knowledge, but that comes with problems to do with scalability.  However selling tangible goods means that there might be a quicker turnaround for the right products.  It’s something I’d like to try.  It might come in the future.
